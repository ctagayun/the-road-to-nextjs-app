- Setup project from scratch
      md the-road-to-react
      cd 
      npm init 

      npm install react react-dom next (will show dependencies in pkg.json

      change script to:"dev": "next dev"
         so that we have a development server

      . md app -->  touch app/layout.js touch app/page.js
         - will contain all the routing (NO NEEE creating a separate 'PAGES" folder)
 
 NEXT.JS - https://nextjs.org/
   1. npx create-next-app@latest the-road-to-nextjs-app

      - Apparently, the default setup for a Next.js installation no longer includes
      the src/ folder. However, for this course, we'll be using the src/ folder, 
      as shown in the video, since it's a better approach for managing larger 
      applications down the road.

      - go to https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc

      - copy and run: npm install next@rc react@rc react-dom@rc --force

   2. Exploring the NextJS Starter file
      - https://rwieruch.teachable.com/courses/the-road-to-next/lectures/54082445

      - if anyone wants to replicate your project setup all they need to copy are;
          package.json and package.lock.json and run npm install and they 
          get exact "node_modules"
